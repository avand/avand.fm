        Avand started tinkering with mixes back in high school, when he diverted
        time away from hist studies to make jazz remixes of hip-hop bangers—think
        Dave Brubeck layered on top of Notorious B.I.G. His mother was insistent
        on him learning classical piano, which he reluctantly practiced for hours
        every day for about a decade under the tutelage Russian instructor. This
        time may not have taught Avand to appreciate music but it certaintly did
        teach him to understand it.

        Appreciation came later, in his late twenties, when Avand had the freedom
        to discover music that spoke to him directly. He began building his digital
        library, which is an ever-evolving collection of eclectic music from all
        over the world. But all tracks eventually lead back to house. Whether it’s
        lighting up the dance floor, setting the backdrop for the perfect party,
        or taking the listener on a journey, Avand’s sets are always a celebration
        of the human experience.

        From Mexico City to San Francisco—from the underground club to the desert—
        Avand has a wide range of experience performing in different environments.
        His priority is to create a space where people can feel safe and connect
        with the music so they can, in turn, connect more deeply with themselves
        and one another. Avand believes that music is the highest form of communication
        and that it has the power to heal and transform. In Farsi, the name ”Avand”
        means the vascular system of a tree that delivers nutriets to its leaves,
        and that is the purpose he embodies when he gets behind the decks.

        Avand started tinkering with mixes back in high school, when he diverted
        time away from his studies to make jazz remixes of hip-hop bangers‚Äîthink
        Dave Brubeck layered on top of Notorious B.I.G. His mother was insistent
        on him learning classical piano, which he reluctantly practiced for
        hours every day for about a decade under the tutelage of a strict
        Russian instructor. This time may not have taught Avand to appreciate
        music but it certaintly did teach him to understand it.

        Appreciation came later, in his late twenties, when Avand had the
        freedom to discover music that spoke to him directly. He began building
        his digital library, which is an ever-evolving collection of eclectic
        music from all over the world. But all tracks eventually lead back to
        house. Whether it‚Äôs lighting up the dance floor, setting the backdrop
        for the perfect party, or taking the listener on a journey, Avand‚Äôs sets
        are always a celebration of the human experience.

        From Mexico City to San Francisco‚Äîfrom the underground club to the
        desert‚ÄîAvand has a wide range of experience performing in different
        environments. His priority is to create a space where people can feel
        safe and connect with the music so they can, in turn, connect more
        deeply with themselves and one another. Avand believes that music is the
        highest form of communication and that it has the power to heal and
        transform. In Farsi, ‚Äùavand‚Äù means the vascular system of a tree that
        delivers nutriets to its leaves, and that is the purpose he embodies
        when he gets behind the decks.

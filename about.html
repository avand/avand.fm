        I started tinkering with mixes back in high school, when I diverted
        time away from my studies to make jazz remixes of hip-hop bangers—think
        Dave Brubeck layered on top of Notorious B.I.G. My mother was insistent
        on me learning classical piano. So for about a decade, I practiced almost
        every day and took lessons with a rigorous Russian instructor. This time
        didn’t teach me to appreciate music but it did teach me to understand it.

        Appreciation would come much later, in my late twenties, when I had the
        freedom to inquire about music that spoke to me directly. Before that,
        though, I had go through a hording phase, where it was my mission to
        possess a hard drive of every song, all meticulously organized. Now,
        I’m still meticulously organized but my library is deeply personal.
        It took years for my brain to accept that my library only had to make
        sense to me. I think that had a lot to do with my momentum as a DJ in
        the last few years.

        For the most part, I DJ renegade parties, which I often am also hosting.
        I enjoy building powerful sound systems and love how speakers sound outside.

        I’m also a software engineer and I contribute to a utility called
        <a href="https://github.com/avand/trackquisition">Trackquisition</a>.
        Trackquisition is a workflow-management tool that makes acquiring tracks easier.
        Think of it like an extension of Spotify that helps you cross-reference your
        own library before making it easy to purchase and acquire the track.

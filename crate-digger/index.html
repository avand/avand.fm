        <h2>What is Crate Digger?</h2>
        <p>
          Crate Digger treats <b>Spotify as your music shopping list</b>. If you use Spotify to aggregate tracks you discover through movies, radio, friends, Shazam, etc.,
          you can use Crate Digger to cross-reference Spotify against your local library so you know what to buy vs. what you already own. For tracks you don't own yet,
          Crate Digger provides <b>one‑click links</b> out to purchase sources (Amazon, Bandcamp, Beatport, etc.).
